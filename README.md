# 186W-a-30MeV-sort
This hub contains the sorting code and informations on the data analysis of the experiment on 186W performed at the Oslo Cyclotron Lab. 
This experiment was done with the SiRi silicon telescope array mounted in backward angles relative to the alpha beam direction 
(covering 126-140 degrees in the lab system).

To compile the sorting code, do:
>make very-clean
and then
>make

To run the code, do:
>./sorting name_of_batchfile.batch
